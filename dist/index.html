                <h3>Lilly</h3>
                Lilith (Lilly) Samson was born to satan-worshipping abusive parents and ran away with her boyfriend Jordan at age 17. They have a tumultuous relationship but neither one has anywhere else to go. Lilly is turned three years later in an
                attempt to vengefully cheat on Jordan. Lilly’s fling is a vampire, unbeknownst to her, and, meaning well, he post-coitally kills her to grant her immortality. The first thing she does with this new power is unintentionally murder
                Jordan to complete her transformation. Lilly takes to being a vampire quite fast, and though she finds it a little macabre to feed on people, she gladly takes it in exchange for being hot forever. <br>

                Mulciber Wulf (often called “Mulci” as a nickname) is a 456 year old vampire born in feudal Germany. He escapes his creator, Count Ivan Wulf, by killing him and taking on his last name and fortune. Currently, Mulciber lives in the
                city, working on his medical degree at a local college and teaching undergrad biology classes to make ends meet. He takes pity on Lilly crying over a man she had just fed on, and Mulci keeps him from turning for her. The two are fast
                friends and eventually end up living together in Mulci’s brownstone. <br>

                Lacey Dabney was born in Arizona in 1998, and moved to the city for college. She is currently in her final year of studying computer science at the college Mulci happens to teach at. She gets entangled with Jordan around a year after
                him and Lilly’s “breakup”. Lacey becomes addicted to the high that Jordan’s venom gives her, and the two start a tumultuous, explosive relationship that is the catalyst for the majority of the drama that plagues Mulci and Lilly. Lacey
                is extremely open to adventure, and though she doesn’t particularly want to be a vampire, she agrees to be turned to drive Jordan away when the situation escalates past her control. <br>

                <h3>Jordan</h3>
                Jordan Powers is a 24 year old burnout. He desperately wants to break up with Lilly but knows she’s got no one else, so keeps her around and cheats as a compromise. He’s got a tough, mean exterior that shields his years of mommy
                issues and fears. He’s turned accidentally by Lilly’s “first bite” making the process needlessly painful and awful for him, and he wants revenge on Lilly (if she’s even alive) for what she’s turned him into. Jordan’s own secret sexual
                deviations carry over into his vampirism, and he gets particular and unique pleasure from his feedings. <br>

      <h2>Being Turned</h2>
      <p>In order to turn you have to die with vampire venom circulating in your system, the human heart stops and the vampire virus in the venom overtakes the corpse and reanimates it (reanimation can take anywhere from several hours to several
        days depending on the condition of the body, and if it has been too severely damaged or missing parts i.e. organs ripped out/dismembered they won’t reanimate at all), with the catch that human blood must be consumed within 48 hours after
        reanimation to feed the virus and complete the change, or the virus dies and it’s host re-dies. This “first bite” that completes the transformation is the most dangerous, as it is the point at which the venom is most potent before having
        gained its pain-numbing properties, and new vampires have the tendency to leave their victims drained and dead, triggering another transformation. Mature venom also reduces the pain of feeding, making it easier to do stealthily if one does
        not intend to kill their victim, however the virus in the venom will remain in the victim’s system for several days after feeding, which can cause complications if they happen to die in this window, as well as behavioral changes (drawn back
        to scene of feeding, insomnia, cravings for rare meat). Certain victims taste uniquely good to vampires as a result of a genetic quirk, and in turn the victim will experience a high accompanying the venom, this phenomenon is rare, but it
        makes for dangerous vampire/human relationships.

      <h2>Powers</h2>
      <p>heightened night vision/sense of smell, fast healing (virus will do anything to preserve host), Hypnotism (only works on humans with venom in their system/takes practice or age to perfect), heightened speed (not much faster than a human,
        caps out at around 35-40mph depending on how fit the host was before reanimation). Healing: (mature) vampire saliva can heal over the wounds left by feeding, in order to seal in venom.
        <img src="http://placekitten.com/400/400" alt="placeholder for parallax floater" class="parallax-floater">
        Reanimation: do not need to eat human food, do not age
        (virus halts telomere degradation), hair/nails still grow as a way to expel toxins (100% of consumed blood goes to powering reanimated body), eyes remain the same color but scleras get glowy like a cat’s bc night vision. skin is tough and can
        withstand extreme heat and cold, but does not really change in appearance besides the fact that no blemishes form.

      <h2> Nerfs </h2>
      <p>Eyes and skin are extremely sensitive to the sun, can be severely damaged or even killed by UV light if exposed to it for too long. Nocturnal circadian rhythm shift, due to the aforementioned nerf, they mostly hunt at night.
        Territorial
        instinct: difficult for groups of vampires to work together, typically never seen in more than a pair, if that, fights can break out easily if multiple vampires are hunting in the same territory or if there was already bad blood before they
        were turned. Fangs are not retractable, and quite noticeable if one looks too closely (not that any human could get that close and survive.) They do need sleep, but far less than humans (around 2-3 hours a day). Need to feed about once a
        month at minimum to survive.
        Stakes are ineffective at fully killing a vampire (fire or enough sunlight can kill them though) but will incapacitate them for as long as they are driven through the heart (paralyzed, still able to
        think/speak).
        In rare cases like territorial fights a vampire will become infected with another vampire’s venom, causing illness, and even death if left untreated.</p>
