      <h2>Being Turned</h2>
      <p>In order to turn you have to die with vampire venom circulating in your system, the human heart stops and the vampire virus in the venom overtakes the corpse and reanimates it (reanimation can take anywhere from several hours to several
        days depending on the condition of the body, and if it has been too severely damaged or missing parts i.e. organs ripped out/dismembered they won’t reanimate at all), with the catch that human blood must be consumed within 48 hours after
        reanimation to feed the virus and complete the change, or the virus dies and it’s host re-dies. This “first bite” that completes the transformation is the most dangerous, as it is the point at which the venom is most potent before having
        gained its pain-numbing properties, and new vampires have the tendency to leave their victims drained and dead, triggering another transformation. Mature venom also reduces the pain of feeding, making it easier to do stealthily if one does
        not intend to kill their victim, however the virus in the venom will remain in the victim’s system for several days after feeding, which can cause complications if they happen to die in this window, as well as behavioral changes (drawn back
        to scene of feeding, insomnia, cravings for rare meat). Certain victims taste uniquely good to vampires as a result of a genetic quirk, and in turn the victim will experience a high accompanying the venom, this phenomenon is rare, but it
        makes for dangerous vampire/human relationships.

      <h2>Powers</h2>
      <p>heightened night vision/sense of smell, fast healing (virus will do anything to preserve host), Hypnotism (only works on humans with venom in their system/takes practice or age to perfect), heightened speed (not much faster than a human,
        caps out at around 35-40mph depending on how fit the host was before reanimation). Healing: (mature) vampire saliva can heal over the wounds left by feeding, in order to seal in venom. Reanimation: do not need to eat human food, do not age
        (virus halts telomere degradation), hair/nails still grow as a way to expel toxins (100% of consumed blood goes to powering reanimated body), eyes remain the same color but scleras get glowy like a cat’s bc night vision. skin is tough and can
        withstand extreme heat and cold, but does not really change in appearance besides the fact that no blemishes form.
      </p>

    <div class="parallax_img parallax_img3" id="img1"></div>
    <section>
      <h2> Nerfs </h2>
      <p>Eyes and skin are extremely sensitive to the sun, can be severely damaged or even killed by UV light if exposed to it for too long. Nocturnal circadian rhythm shift, due to the aforementioned nerf, they mostly hunt at night.
      <p>Territorial
        instinct: difficult for groups of vampires to work together, typically never seen in more than a pair, if that, fights can break out easily if multiple vampires are hunting in the same territory or if there was already bad blood before they
        were turned. Fangs are not retractable, and quite noticeable if one looks too closely (not that any human could get that close and survive.) They do need sleep, but far less than humans (around 2-3 hours a day). Need to feed about once a
        month at minimum to survive.</p>
      <p>Stakes are ineffective at fully killing a vampire (fire or enough sunlight can kill them though) but will incapacitate them for as long as they are driven through the heart (paralyzed, still able to
        think/speak).
        In rare cases like territorial fights a vampire will become infected with another vampire’s venom, causing illness, and even death if left untreated.</p>
