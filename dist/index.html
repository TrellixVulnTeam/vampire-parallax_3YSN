                <h3>Lilly</h3>
                Lilith (Lilly) Samson was born to satan-worshipping abusive parents and ran away with her boyfriend Jordan at age 17. They have a tumultuous relationship but neither one has anywhere else to go. Lilly is turned three years later in an
                attempt to vengefully cheat on Jordan. Lilly’s fling is a vampire, unbeknownst to her, and, meaning well, he post-coitally kills her to grant her immortality. The first thing she does with this new power is unintentionally murder
                Jordan to complete her transformation. Lilly takes to being a vampire quite fast, and though she finds it a little macabre to feed on people, she gladly takes it in exchange for being hot forever. <br>

                Mulciber Wulf (often called “Mulci” as a nickname) is a 456 year old vampire born in feudal Germany. He escapes his creator, Count Ivan Wulf, by killing him and taking on his last name and fortune. Currently, Mulciber lives in the
                city, working on his medical degree at a local college and teaching undergrad biology classes to make ends meet. He takes pity on Lilly crying over a man she had just fed on, and Mulci keeps him from turning for her. The two are fast
                friends and eventually end up living together in Mulci’s brownstone. <br>

                Lacey Dabney was born in Arizona in 1998, and moved to the city for college. She is currently in her final year of studying computer science at the college Mulci happens to teach at. She gets entangled with Jordan around a year after
                him and Lilly’s “breakup”. Lacey becomes addicted to the high that Jordan’s venom gives her, and the two start a tumultuous, explosive relationship that is the catalyst for the majority of the drama that plagues Mulci and Lilly. Lacey
                is extremely open to adventure, and though she doesn’t particularly want to be a vampire, she agrees to be turned to drive Jordan away when the situation escalates past her control. <br>

                Jordan Powers is a 24 year old burnout. He desperately wants to break up with Lilly but knows she’s got no one else, so keeps her around and cheats as a compromise. He’s got a tough, mean exterior that shields his years of mommy
                issues and fears. He’s turned accidentally by Lilly’s “first bite” making the process needlessly painful and awful for him, and he wants revenge on Lilly (if she’s even alive) for what she’s turned him into. Jordan’s own secret sexual
                deviations carry over into his vampirism, and he gets particular and unique pleasure from his feedings. <br>

      <h2>Being Turned</h2>
      <p>Being turned into a vampire is a several-step process that can go wrong very easily. The first step, of course, is to be bitten. Vampire saliva is the catalyst for the transformation, when it comes into contact with the bacteria on the fangs
        it inoculates the virus and transfers the viral cells into their host. The second property of the saliva is quite important too, it has the ability to heal over the bite wound left by the feeding, to seal in the virus.
        It is rare for one to be turned the same night they are bitten, most vampires operate a lot like komodo dragons, dosing their victim with venom over a long period of time before finishing the job and killing them, typically not by draining
        blood, as the most a vampire can consume at a time alone is 1.5-2 pints, most drain-kills occur when multiple vampires feed on a victim, and these do not result in transformations due to immune complications with venom-mixing.
        <img src="../dist/img/jordan-floater.png" alt="placeholder for parallax floater" class="parallax-floater1">
        When the victim
        dies, there are specific conditions for them to be turned. The first of these conditions is that they must have had the venom of ONE vampire circulating in their veins upon death, if multiple venom strains exist in the body, they will attack
        one another to oblivion at the beginning of the reanimation process and it won’t continue. When the heart stops, the venom leaves the blood and releases phages into the nearest cell, one by one the cells are reanimated and propped up by the
        virus in the venom, which will keep multiplying and evolving as the vampire ages. Reanimation can take anywhere from 10 hours to 4 days, depending on the amount of venom in the system and the state of the body on death. If a body has been too
        severely damaged (missing organs, missing limbs that weren’t missing to begin with, head/heart/brain removed) the transformation will not occur.

      <h2>Powers</h2>
      <p>
        Vampires have heightened abilities that exceed that of regular humans. They have the classic traits one would expect from pop culture: great sense of smell, night vision, and fast healing. The enhancement to smell allows vampires to sniff out
        prey by the smell of their blood. A typical human nose couldn’t pick up the subtle differences between blood types, or even smell non-exposed blood at all. The night vision comes at the expense of a circadian rhythm shift that compels
        vampires to be active mainly at night. Vampires heal fast, though they are technically a corpse, because the virus will do anything to protect its host, and the virus-infected blood is more sensitive to the elements than human blood (veins
        sink further into the skin to protect it, reason for pale coloring on many vampires).
        <img src="../dist/img/floater300x300.png" alt="placeholder for parallax floater" class="parallax-floater">
        Vampires do not need human food at all, though they can eat it, and expel toxins through the growth of their hair and nails, as all of the blood consumed goes to powering the body. Vampires do not age, as the virus halts the degradation of
        their telomeres, and freezes them at the age they were turned (i.e. Mulci was turned at 19, and thus is physically 19 forever) Vampires also have heightened speed, they are not much faster than humans, but can run anywhere from 35-40mph
        depending on how fit they were when human. They have glowing sclera like a cat’s, and can withstand extremely cold and hot temperatures.

      <h2> Nerfs </h2>
      <p>
        With vampire abilities also come the setbacks, the biggest one of course being that they cannot go in the sun. This is due in part to the circadian rhythm shift, and the development of night vision, the sun’s brightness is incredibly harsh on
        vampire vision. It is also due to the virus’s sensitivity to UV light. UV light is the real killer of vampires, exposure to it for too long or too intensely can kill a vampire instantly, so when they take their rare ventures into the sun they
        must take extreme precautions. Vampires prefer lower elevations and places with low UV levels for this reason (it’s incredibly unlikely you would find one in say… Colorado).
        <img src="../dist/img/lilly-floater.png" alt="placeholder for parallax floater" class="parallax-floater2"> Stakes cannot fully kill a vampire, but can incapacitate them for a
        considerable amount of time given that they are staked correctly through the heart. Venom-mixing, mentioned earlier, can kill a vampire. If bitten by a peer, the vampire will exhibit an immune response similar to a sick human, if the foreign
        venom is too concentrated or the wound is untreated, this sickness can progress into death as the foreign virus and domestic virus battle. Vampires, contrary to popular belief, do need sleep, but far less than their human counterparts, they
        sleep for about 2-4 hours a day. Vampires can also starve to death, and they must feed at least once a month to get by, but it is recommended that they feed more like once every 2 weeks to thrive.

      <h2 class="lighten">More on Venom</h2>
      <p class="lighten">
        A vampire’s venom is their most important signature. No two strains of venom are the same, as when the transformation occurs, the virus and venom are “activated” by melding with the DNA of the host. Venom can be deadly to other vampires in
        the circumstance that it gets under their tough skin and is detected by the viral immune system. Venom is not dangerous to other vampires, though in the case of ingestion or shallower bites, any circumstance where the toxin can be digested or
        broken down.
        Venom has far more powerful qualities when it applies to humans. Venom has pain-numbing properties akin to opiates that can work in varying degrees on humans, even inducing a strange psychedelic-esque high in some.
        <img src="../dist/img/floater200x300.png" alt="placeholder for parallax floater" class="parallax-floater3">
        These
        properties don’t develop until after the venom has matured, though, so a new vampire’s first victim will always feel the pain of the bite and transformation more acutely, a phenomenon called the “first bite”.
        Vampires also gain powers of hypnotism over humans with their venom in their system, the strength of which varies depending on the age and potency of the venom, hypnotism is a common tool for the komodo-like behavior vampires exhibit,
        compelling their victim to return to the scene again and again to be re-infected with venom until the vampire feeding on them decides their fate. Hereditary venom interactions are often the most volatile of vampire relationships, as a sire
        will often feel a parentlike instinct toward the newborn they created which the newborn is rare to reciprocate. This phenomenon and the specific circumstances for reanimation make large families of sires and children rare to the point of
        impossibility.
